## About K-Hex
K-Hex is a hexadecimal system developed for data-exchanges in korea. It uses scientific character, "Hangul" instead of stupid latin-western yankee trash "alphabet".  
  
So you can understand your data even better!  

### K-Hex Specification
Instead of using inferior "yankee latin-western trash" Latin Alphabet in 10-15 equivalent in hexadecimal system `"A,B,C,D,E,F"`, **K-Hex** uses revised "Hangul" character order developed by Sigyeong Ju, `"ㄱ,ㄴ,ㄷ,ㄹ,ㅁ,ㅂ"`

### Pros of using K-Hex
* No longer need to check for capital characters
* Works fantastically on CP949, UTF-8, EUC-KR
* Provides better readability of the output by using more bytes.

### Cons

NONE.  

If you think you have found one, Tell the issue on Twi**er.  
All of the Hangul lovers and K-POP fans will take your feedback with our feedback retrieval technology<sup>[patent pending]</sup> and make the K-Hex better than ever.  

<sub>*Patent Pending method: They will cancel you for being "rebel against the state"</sub>
